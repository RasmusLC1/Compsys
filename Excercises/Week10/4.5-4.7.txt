4.5 In this exercise, we examine in detail how an instruction is executed in a 
single-cycle datapath. Problems in this exercise refer to a clock cycle in which the 
processor fetches the following instruction word: 0x00c6ba23.


4.5.1 [10] <§4.4> What are the values of the ALU control unit’s inputs for this 
instruction?

	0	0	C	6A	A	2	3
0000	0000	1100	0110	1010	1010	0010	0011

|imm[11-5]   |	Rs2	Rs1	f3	MM[4-0]|    OPCODE  |

Decimal version:
OPCODE (00100011) 35
IMM	20
F3	2
Rs1	13
rs2	12


SW X12 20(x13)


4.5.2 [5] <§4.4> What is the new PC address after this instruction is executed? 
Highlight the path through which this value is determined.
PC becomes 4
4.5.3 [10] <§4.4> For each mux, show the values of its inputs and outputs during 
the execution of this instruction. List values that are register outputs at Reg [xn].

The alu value is our SW value where we have 20 time 13 for the first mux, we therefore get 0 in the first mutux, then we write it to the address, so we get one and then finally we get 0

4.5.4 [10] <§4.4> What are the input values for the ALU and the two add units?

4.5.5 [10] <§4.4> What are the values of all inputs for the registers unit?
