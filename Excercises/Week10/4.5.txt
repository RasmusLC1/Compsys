.5 In this exercise, we examine in detail how an instruction is executed in a 
single-cycle datapath. Problems in this exercise refer to a clock cycle in which the 
processor fetches the following instruction word: 0x00c6ba23.

4.5.1 [10] <§4.4> What are the values of the ALU control unit’s inputs for this 
instruction?


Hex converted to binary:		 0000	0000	1100	0110	1010	1010	0010	0011
Binary converted to RisV protocol: 	0000000	01100	01101	010	10100	0100011
					
see 5.1.png for explanation

Our final instruction is then SW x12 20(x13)

What this means is that we add 20 onto our x12value and store that value in x13

4.5.2 [5] <§4.4> What is the new PC address after this instruction is executed? 
Highlight the path through which this value is determined.

the PC address is 4 after the instructions have been executed

4.5.3 [10] <§4.4> For each mux, show the values of its inputs and outputs during 
the execution of this instruction. List values that are register outputs at Reg [xn].

see 5.2.png for flow

In the first green run the PCSrc is 0

After it returns following the red line it is 1 in ALUSrc as we are using our immediate, so 20 and add that to x12 and MemtoReg is 0 as we do not need to read from memory	


4.5.4 [10] <§4.4> What are the input values for the ALU and the two add units?

read reg1 = value on x13

read reg2 = value on x12

The first value for the ALU is 20 

We then write so it becomes reg2 = x12+20
