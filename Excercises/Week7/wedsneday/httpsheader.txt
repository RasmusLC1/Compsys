a. A user requests a Web page that consists of some text and three images.
For this page, the client will send one request message and receive four
response messages.
false, it sends a request for each image as well, so we send 4 requests as we need to get each element of the webpage and get 4 replies

b. Two distinct Web pages (for example, www.mit.edu/research
.html and www.mit.edu/students.html) can be sent over the
same persistent connection.
true, it's the same domain and it is persisten so it should bee fine

c. With nonpersistent connections between browser and origin server, it is
possible for a single TCP segment to carry two distinct HTTP request
messages.
False, it's not possible as it is not persisten so it will break between the two requests

d. The Date: header in the HTTP response message indicates when the
object in the response was last modified.
false, it's the time it was sent and recieved

e. HTTP response messages never have an empty message body
false, it can be empty



P4.
Consider the following string of ASCII characters that were captured by
Wireshark when the browser sent an HTTP GET message (i.e., this is the
actual content of an HTTP GET message). The characters <cr><lf> are
carriage return and line-feed characters (that is, the italized character string
<cr> in the text below represents the single carriage-return character that was
contained at that point in the HTTP header). Answer the following questions,
indicating where in the HTTP GET message below you find the answer.
