P3. Consider the polyalphabetic system shown in Figure 8.4. Will a chosen plaintext attack that is able to get the plaintext encoding of the message “The 
quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” be sufficient to decode all messages? Why or why not?

No, because the values jumps between the 2 layers, so you would be able to make a good guess and the
you can probably guess your way to the rest but not with 100% security


 P8. Consider RSA with p = 7 and q = 13.
a. What are n and z?
b. Let e be 17. Why is this an acceptable choice for e?
c. Find d such that de = 1 (mod z).
d. Encrypt the message m = 9 using the key (n, e). Let c denote the corresponding ciphertext. Show all work
